# Audio Classification Using Deep Learning

## Project Overview
This project focuses on classifying audio signals into 10 distinct classes using a  Neural Network (NN) built and trained on a Kaggle dataset. The objective is to demonstrate the effectiveness of deep learning techniques in audio signal processing and classification.

## Features
- Built a NN model tailored for audio classification.
- Preprocessed audio data into spectrograms for efficient feature extraction.
- Achieved high accuracy in distinguishing between 10 audio classes.
- Utilized Python and TensorFlow for model development.
- Dataset sourced from Kaggle.

## Tools & Technologies
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Deep Learning Framework**: TensorFlow
- **Dataset Source**: Kaggle
- **Libraries**: NumPy, pandas, librosa, matplotlib, scikit-learn

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains audio recordings across 10 classes. It was sourced from Kaggle. Each audio file was preprocessed to extract mel spectrograms, which were used as inputs to the CNN model.

## Future Work
- Expand the dataset to include more classes and diversity.
- Experiment with different architectures (e.g., RNNs or Transformers).
- Deploy the model for real-time audio classification.
